# Feature Select

```shell
git checkout feature-select
```

## Tasks
- There are 3 branches with syntax `feature-A|B|C`. without editing the code directly (exept for merge conflicts). Add A,B and C feature to `feature.txt`
  - You must do this in a `Add feature A B C` commit.
  - It is better to reference feature commit hashes in commit description.
