# Git practical assignment

There are 4 exercises; for each one, you need to `checkout` to its branch specified in `{problem_name}/README.md`. After that, complete the tasks in **the same branch**.

Make sure to `checkout main` after finishing the problems.

## Submission
You must set up a **private** clone of this repository and complete the tasks. After the deadline, you will be asked to add the TAs as collaborators for grading. 


## Acknowledgement
These challenges are inspired by [https://gitexercises.fracz.com](https://gitexercises.fracz.com/). We strongly suggest you try all exercises from there.
