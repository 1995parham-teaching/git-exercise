# Merge conflict resolution
## Tasks
- Merge branch `story-modification` with `merge-explicit` in a way that the story in `story.md` makes sense.
  - **Merge using explicit strategies (with explicit merge commits)**.
- Merge the branch `story-modification` with `merge-implicit` with `fast-forward`/`rebase` strategy.
  - With this strategy there mustn't be a explicit merge commit in history.
